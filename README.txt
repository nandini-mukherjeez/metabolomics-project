This project analyzes the complete (intracellular and extracellular) metabolome of the necrotrophic fungi Macrophomina phaseolina at 28°C and 35°C to identify differentially expressed metabolites.
  
Tools: Excel / Python / R  
Results: top metabolites with low p-values of < 0.05 and VIP scores > 1, PCA plots, OPLS-DA plots, VIP Scores, Pathway enrichment analysis.

The detailed analysis of the dataset are presented in Chapter 3: "Metabolites" of my master’s thesis.
