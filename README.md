# Fungal Metabolomics Analysis: Macrophomina phaseolina

This project analyzes the **complete metabolome (intracellular and extracellular)** of the necrotrophic fungus *Macrophomina phaseolina* at **28°C and 35°C**. The goal is to identify **differentially expressed metabolites** and explore metabolic changes under different temperatures.

## Tools Used
- Excel (data organization and initial analysis)  
- Python/R (for statistical analysis and visualization)  

## Key Results
- Identification of top differentially expressed metabolites with p-values < 0.05 & VIP scores > 1.
- PCA, OPLS-DA, Pathway enrichment analysis graphs, etc.

## Reference
Elaboration of the dataset and detailed analysis are presented in [**Chapter 3: "Metabolites"**](https://github.com/nandini-mukherjeez/metabolomics-project/blob/main/Analysis/NandiniMukherjee_Thesis_Final.pdf) of my master’s thesis.
